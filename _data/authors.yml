His research examines different physical processes impact on sea-level change in the past and future under changing climate. He focuses on developing novel physical and statistical tools to better understand the mechanisms that drive spatio-temporal variability of sea-level change, which can be used to produce more accurate and robust sea-level projections. In free time, Yucheng enjoys reading, cooking, climbing and hiking.

     Statistics is the mathematical body of science pertaining to collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.  The complex nature of the spatial and temporal data used for
     climate process reconstruction produces unique statistical challenges, which highlight the importance of interdisciplinary research.  Without an understanding of the scientific processes underlying
     observable data, as well as the theoretical foundations of the statistical tools used in analysis, the data may be misinterpreted.  I am interested in applying this theory to the current problems in
     prediction and forecasting, as well as modeling, of the relationships between sea level and ice sheet volumes over time and space, as they relate to unobservable parameters of the geoid.  Using
     commonly accepted ice sheet histories and earth parameter profiles, including different lithospheric thicknesses, and upper and lower mantle viscosities, I am developing a stochastic emulator of the
     sea-level equation.

     Praveen Kumar is a postdoctoral researcher in the Earth System Science & Policy Lab at Rutgers University, where he currently works on producing sea-level hindcasts and projections using the Framework for Assessment of Changes To Sea-level (FACTS). His research focuses on understanding the role of climate variability in influencing ocean-atmosphere interactions through the examination of feedbacks between ice sheets, oceans, and the atmosphere. In addition to his work on sea-level change, Praveen is also interested in the potential impact of climate variability on the economy and human well-being, as well as the application of climate risk management under conditions of deep uncertainty. As a native of the Goan coastline, Praveen is committed to understanding the potential risks that climate change poses to global coastal communities. In his leisure time, Praveen enjoys playing table tennis, cooking, and spending time by the water.

        I am broadly interested in sea level research and climate and how sea level rise into the future will affect coastal communities. My research examines past sea-level change to bridge the gap between short-term instrumental records and long-term geological reconstructions and to better understand future sea-level rise under changing climate. I focus on reconstructing Holocene sea-level changes along the U.S. Atlantic coast using biological and geological indicators. These proxies are used to quantify rates of sea-level change and examine spatial and temporal variability. The goal of this research is to improve understanding of past sea level to better predict how sea level rise into the future will affect coastal systems and coastal communities.

       I am pursuing a PhD in Planning and Public Policy at the Bloustein School. My research interest lies at the intersection of coastal climate risk and resilience, land use planning, and social equity issues. I plan to apply mixed methods and transdisciplinary research approaches to better understand how communities are adapting to coastal hazards. Along with the physical risks that threaten coastal communities (e.g.: sea level rise, storms and storm surge, erosion), I study the spatial distribution of social vulnerability, patterns of coastal development, and the political, institutional, and practical barriers to implementing efficient and equitable adaptation strategies. I am currently developing a research design to evaluate equity considerations in federally funded property-acquisition programs. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Master’s degree in City and Regional Planning in 2019. Prior to Georgia Tech I spent 5 years in Puerto Rico where I worked in climate change adaptation and hazard mitigation planning.

       Diana is a PhD student in the Atmospheric Science program through the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University. Her research, as part of the Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub (MACH) Hazards team, investigates extreme flood risk from storm surge associated with extratropical cyclones (locally known as nor’easters). Her professional goals include using scientific research to aid organizations affected by climate change and extreme weather events. Prior to her graduate studies, she worked on the Catastrophe Modeling and Applied Research team at The Hartford Insurance Group. She graduated from Penn State University in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, a minor in Energy Business and Finance, and a Certificate in Geographic Information Science. In her free time, Diana enjoys being outdoors, whether she is hiking, biking, or paddle boarding.

       Dan Blanco is a PhD student in the Atmospheric Science program through the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University. They hold a Bachelor’s degree in Physics with an emphasis in mathematics from Lewis University. They are a former CIERA REU student through Northwestern University where their work focused on the Laurentian Great Lakes hydrology. They are affiliated with the Climate Impact Lab and the MACH Hazards Team. Their work aims to use climate models in better understanding the idea of time of emergence of climate change, particularly when it comes to future projections of sea level rise.  A combination of natural hazards forecasting and socioeconomic data will be used alongside statistical methods to determine the time of emergence of sea level rise for the Northeastern U.S. This work will assist policy makers and urban planners to determine when and where detections of sea-level changes become regionally evident beyond natural variability. Local risk assessment, mitigation, and adaptation planning can benefit from this work to better facilitate community responses to sea level rise.
