## Sea Level Science Grapples with Uncertainty and Usability 
*by Sarah Stanley, EOS*

Millions of people around the world live in coastal communities that are directly threatened by sea level rise. In a new review, Kopp et al. explore the state of sea level science and highlight key challenges in using it to inform adaptation responses to evolving coastlines. <a href="https://eos.org/research-spotlights/sea-level-science-grapples-with-uncertainty-and-usability" class="btn"><span>Read More</span></a>
