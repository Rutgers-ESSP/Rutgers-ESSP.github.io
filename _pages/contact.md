For more information about the Lab, please contact program coordinator [Moira Scheeler](mailto:moira-dot-scheeler-at-rutgers-dot-edu).


We welcome applications from potential graduate students and postdocs with strong computational skills who want to join our group's eclectic mix of statisticians, geoscientists, climate modelers, and policy scholars. Potential graduate students can apply through a variety of Rutgers programs, including [Atmospheric Science](http://envsci.rutgers.edu/academics/atmos_grad/), [Geological Sciences](https://eps.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-program),  [Oceanography](https://marine.rutgers.edu/main/academics/graduate), [Statistics](https://www.stat.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate-program), and [Planning and Public Policy](https://bloustein.rutgers.edu/graduate/doctoral-studies/), and are encouraged to consider the [Coastal Climate Risk & Resilience](http://c2r2.rutgers.edu/) certificate program. 

If you are looking for sea level rise projections, we encourage you to start with the NASA projection visualization tools for the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€™s Sixth Assessment Report](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool) and the [US Interagency Sea Level Rise Task Force](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/task-force-scenario-tool).
