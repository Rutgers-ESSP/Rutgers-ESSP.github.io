Major projects within our Lab at the moment include:

* reconstructing sea-level and ice-sheet changes on timescales ranging from the 20th century, to the late Holocene, to the last 150 thousand years, through statistical and geophysical modeling of geological and observational records;
* probabilistically projecting future changes in sea levels and their implications for changing coastal flood risk, and translating those projected changes into actionable information for coastal adaptation; and
* linking probabilistic simple climate models, complex Earth system models, and econometric analyses of historical weathering and climate impacts to project future risks associated with climate change and improve estimates of the social cost of carbon.

We have close collaborations with colleagues at the [Princeton Science, Technology & Environmental Policy program](https://www.princeton.edu/step/),  the [Berkeley Global Policy Lab](http://www.solomonhsiang.com/lab), the [Earth Observatory of Singapore Sea Level Lab](https://earthobservatory.sg/research-group/sea-level-research-benjamin-horton), and the [Harvard Sea Level Dynamics group](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k92805).
