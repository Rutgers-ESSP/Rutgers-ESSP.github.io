excerpt: "The Earth System Science & Policy Lab addresses four interrelated questions: How has sea level changed in the past? How may sea level change in the future in response to climate forcing? How do climate and sea-level change impact the economy and human well-being? And how can climate and sea-level science more effectively support climate risk management under deep uncertainty? "

The Earth System Science & Policy Lab is housed within the [Rutgers Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences](http://eoas.rutgers.edu) and the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences' [Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences](http://eps.rutgers.edu/). Key Lab collaborations and partnerships include the:

* [Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub (MACH)](https://coastalhub.org/),
* [Climate Impact Lab](http://www.impactlab.org/), and
* [NASA Sea Level Change Team](https://sealevel.nasa.gov).

The [Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS)](https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts), an open-source sea-level projection framework developed by the Lab, supports the integration of projections for sea-level projections including those the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€™s Sixth Assessment Report](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool) and the [US Interagency Sea Level Rise Task Force](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/task-force-scenario-tool).
