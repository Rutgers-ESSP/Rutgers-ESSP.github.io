excerpt: "The Earth System Science & Policy Lab addresses four interrelated questions: How has sea level changed in the past? How may sea level change in the future in response to climate forcing? How do climate and sea-level change impact the economy and human well-being? And how can climate and sea-level science more effectively support climate risk management under deep uncertainty? "

The Earth System Science & Policy Lab is  housed within the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences' [Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences](http://eps.rutgers.edu/). Key Lab collaborations and partnerships include the:

* [Megalopolitan Coastal Transformation Hub (MACH)](https://coastalhub.org/),
* [Climate Impact Lab](http://www.impactlab.org/), and
* [NASA Sea Level Change Team](https://sealevel.nasa.gov).

Within MACH, our team provides overall project leadership, contributes to projections of  sea-level change and coastal storm hazards, and works on integrating natural and human system elements to support systems understanding and decision-making. Within the Climate Impact Lab, our work focuses on synthesizing current and future climate hazard information to drive climate risk analysis. Within the NASA Sea Level Change Team,  our work focuses on integrating multiple lines of climate, cryosphere, and oceanographic information to produce integrated sea-level rise projections and inform decision-making.

The Lab also develops cyberinfrastructure to support climate hazard analysis. 
The [Framework for Assessing Changes To Sea-level (FACTS)](https://github.com/radical-collaboration/facts), an open-source sea-level projection framework, supports the integration of projections for sea-level projections including those the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€™s Sixth Assessment Report](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool) and the [US Interagency Sea Level Rise Task Force](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/task-force-scenario-tool).  Our spatiotemporal modeling framework [PaleoSTeHM](https://github.com/radical-collaboration/PaleoSTeHM/) makes readily accessible modern techniques for reconstructing paleo-sea level and paleo-environmental fields.
